# The Technical Interview

Every interview will have different questions. These can take many forms including whiteboard problems, computer science theory questions, riddles, live coding on a computer, or Github Repos looking for improvements. Opinions vary greatly on the efficacy of each of these methods. The point of this lecture isn’t to make you an expert in any of these topics or to say Prime endorses them, it’s to make it so that when you hear these terms in an interview, you can know what to expect. Not knowing these things DOES NOT mean you will not get a job.

> If you aren’t getting rejected on a regular basis, you aren’t trying hard enough.

## What is a technical interview?

### Who? 
Often times your future developer buddies or your future technical manager. Titles often include (Developer, Lead, Architect). These are people who typically know how to code and have been doing it for a while.

### When?
After they decide they like you a little (or that your resume now makes you look like a developer). Good job! Now you need to show them you have the technical chops.

### Where?
Most of the time, these will be on site, sometimes, these can be on a google doc or something else for live coding.

### Why?
For entry level positions many companies are looking for, “People who can find the answers.” You need to show that you are that person. Ask questions, and show them that they would want you on their team.

### A few notes

- Technical accuracy is priority.
- Students should talk through any thought process they have
- Speak to confidence in admitting that they do not know the answer, but should speak to what they know while making it obvious to the interviewer that they are treading in that area. "I don’t know the answer to that, but let me talk about what I do know about that topic..."


## Exercise:

### Objective:

- Expose students to a series of potential questions they may receive as either Whiteboard questions or as free response questions.
- Offer feedback and praise on the different components of a student's answer. 
- Give insight to the students on the kinds of things that interviewers are thinking about as they answer questions.
- Give a chance for the students to be ‘in the hot seat’. This is done by putting students on the spot with a technical question that they may not be prepared for.

### Activity:

1. Setup a room with a table in the middle, and the students in a semi circle around the table.
Instructors sit on the other side of the table, ready to ask questions.
1. A chair is left for a student to sit.
1. Let students know that when they are called on, they have the opportunity to "Pass" without taking a question, but this is good practice for an actual interview.
1. Instructors go around the room from left to right asking if a student is willing to answer a technical question.
1. After going through the class one time, share the remainder of these technical questions with students and have them break into pairs and practice answering these questions (altering who asks the questions).
