# Pair Programming

We'll be pair/trio programming for our first group coding activity.

> Note: This is a real world thing, not just a thing kids do or that we use in the classroom. Many people use pair programming on the job.

For **remote work**, use [VSCode Live Share](../supporting-documentation/live-share.md) to collaborate on code in pairs.

Key takeaways:
- Use 1 computer for coding. First driver forks assignment.  Others can fork from the 1st driver when done so everyone gets the code.
- Communicate - It should not be quiet in here.
- Switch roles - one person should not drive for the whole assignment.
