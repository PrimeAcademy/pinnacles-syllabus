# Intro to Group Work

**Objectives**

- Get students thinking about communication skills and group dynamics
- Introduce framework for group work time usage (read assignment, sync up as a team, divide and conquer)
- Tie in Superpowers activity from student life



Get ready to enjoy group work! We're here to help you recover from the groups in highschool that still give you nightmares. 

Working with others can be complicated, but it's so worth it! We gain so much from our teammates - we just have to be open to it. 

At Prime, the goal of our group projects is to learn how to work together, communicate and support one another - while writing code!

Group work is an important part of coding. We depend on each other to help solve tough problems and accomplish big goals. 

## Before you code:

Read through the requirements of the project on your own. 

Come back to your group and discuss the following items:
  - What are your super powers and weaknesses
  - How do you react in stressful situations
  - What do you need to be successful 
  - What seems most difficult about this project

By taking the time to discuss these items, the group is setting itself up for success. 

Our communication can falter when a situation gets stressful, but if we have taken the time to establish norms before the stressful situation, we can look back and let our past selves guide us forward.

## While you're coding: 

Communicate! A successful team is dependent on open and honest communication. Use those norms you created earlier to help create a safe space where people can try new things, make mistakes and learn together.

Take breaks - a tired mind can get stressed and makes mistakes.

Support each other - don't be afraid to tell someone they're doing a great job! Ask questions, and try to answer questions. 

Remember, we are here to learn! We're learning how to code, but we're also learning how to work together and how to effectively communicate in a group setting. Focus on moving forward together and making sure everyone understands what's being worked on. If one person crosses the finish line and leaves everyone else behind, that is not a good thing.

## After you're done coding:

Do a group or solo "retro" - taking a moment to look back with an honest review of how things went. 
  - What went well?
  - What didn't go so well?
  - What will you do differently next time?
