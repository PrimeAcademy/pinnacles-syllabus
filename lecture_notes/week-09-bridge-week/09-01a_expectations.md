# Bridge Week Intro and Expectations


## What is Bridge Week

- No major new topic/technologies
- But -- there will be lectures and assignments, same level of intensity as the rest of T2
- Deep dive into programming foundations
- A chance to catch up on any incomplete or missing challenges.

	
## Why Bridge Week

- Chance to catch up, if you're gotten behind (in assignments, or in understanding)
- Deeper understanding of code, become more comfortable reading and manipulating code
- Build up the tools in your toolbox for writing and debugging code
- Critical thinking: go beyond pattern following. 

**Overall:** improve your confidence going into the second half of T2, and into the job market.


## Week overview
	
- Share calendar with students, review the general plans

## Resubmissions

If you have any Weekend Challenges or Code Challenges with a _Needs Improvement_ grade, **these must be resubmitted by Thursday at 9am**. 

**This is a requirement to continue with the program.**

Now is your time to catch up on this material. Make good use of this time, so you are ready to continue with the second half of Tier 2. 

## Homework
   
Plan 1-2 hours per night for homework.

If you have weekend challenges or code challenges to resubmit, do these as homework, instead of any other assigned work! 

If all of your graded work is complete, there will be additional assignments to reinforce concepts from the day. 



## Expectations:

- Present, engaged, and asking questions, just like any other week
- Doing homework every night (1-2hrs)
- If you're not sure what to work on, you ask (don't wait for me to check in on you!)
