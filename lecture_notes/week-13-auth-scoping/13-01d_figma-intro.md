# Figma For Full Stack

Figma is a design tool that is popular in the industry. The UX program uses it, and theres a good chance you will interact with it on your job. We aren't focused on all the things, but we are going to use it in a basic way -- to help you make wireframes.

> **NOTE:** Do _not_ create a team in figma. There is a limit to the number of pages you can make in a team design document without a paid subscription.

## Design File vs FigJam

FigJam is a digital whiteboard -- a useful collaboration tool, but not a great way to build wireframes.

Design Files are where we can build our wireframes!

## Basic Interface

Figma can be a bit much at first, but its pretty intuitive once you know where things are and what they mean.

is the tool you'll use the most -- this is how you make shapes! In a wireframe, most everything is a box of some sort.

## Frames
Frames are the foundation of your wireframes. You can make frames a custom size, or adhere to the shape of a screen, for example.

<img width="413" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-11 at 1 27 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11574995/231255813-d8c268ff-d009-417a-84e6-ffaa14691847.png">

For each view, make a frame, and name it the corresponding view in your app. Pick a frame that makes sense, if you are doing desktop or mobile, for example.

You will have many frames.

Adding Shapes to the frames with text can be a great start to wireframes!

## Components and Reusablilty
Often, you have repeated elements across many view/wireframes. Manually making them for each frame works, but if you need to make changes, it is a lot of work to change!

Components have a Diamond Shape and are Purple.

So, instead, if you know you have a repeated element across views, you can turn any selection of shapes into a **COMPONENT**
Right Click a selection and select create component. Or`Option + Command + K`. Then if you copy the base and paste it, the result is a clone of the component. If you change the base component, all the clones also update.
