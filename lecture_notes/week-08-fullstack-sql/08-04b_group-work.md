# Group Project Guidelines

General guidelines to follow for the Koala Holla group project. We'll be refining these next week when we introduce git branching and trello.

## Summary

- 5 - 10 minute reading assignment individually
- 10 minutes talking through how you work as a group
- 15 - 30 minutes whiteboard the project, create a list of tasks
- 10 - 15 minutes **one** member should setup your project repo, using the _Use this Template_ feature in Github. Then add **all** members of the team as contributors

   > NOTE: Do not **fork** your team repository. You should all be contributing to the same repository.

- Divide and conquer. At this point you should still try to work in pairs.
- Re-group and commit your changes frequently

### Read through the project individually

Spend 5 - 10 minutes reading through project requirements.

### How you work as a group

As a group, create a grid an have each member of the team add post-it notes answering each of the following questions.

What do you hope to get out of this project? | What do you do when you're stressed?
--- | ---
**What seems to be the most difficult part of this project?** | **What you can do to help me when I'm stressed**

### Whiteboard the project

As a group, establish what the high level tasks will be and break those down into sub tasks. Put them into three buckets, initial set up, client and server.

### Set up the base project

On **one** computer, setup your project repo using the _Use this Template_ feature in Github. Then add **all** members of the team as contributors. Each member of the team can now clone the same repository.

> NOTE: Do not **fork** your team repository. You should all be contributing to the **same** repository.

### Divide and conquer

I would recommend pairing up and taking either client or server tasks as a pair. Halfway through the project, consider switching so that the client pair is working on the server and vice versa. You will want to coordinate this so that you don't run into merge conflicts.

For **remote work**, use [VSCode Live Share](../supporting-documentation/live-share.md) to collaborate on code.

### Submit your assignment

When you're ready to submit your assignment, each team member should fork your project repo, and submit the forked repo URL to the Prime assignment portal.
